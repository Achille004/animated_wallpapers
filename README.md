# Animated wallpapers
This is a collection of HTML files created and used by me as wallpapers.

## Lively
To set the webpage as wallpaper, I use and suggest [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively), free and open source.
To do this, choose your wallpaper from this repo, then copy it inside the _wallpapers_ folder.
